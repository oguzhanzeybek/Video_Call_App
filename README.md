# Video_Call_App


- There are many areas in this project that can be customized according to your needs.
- This project is a sample demonstration of the codes. 
- The page called "videocall.dart" contains the necessary codes and variables for video calling.
- The page named "Constvariable.dart" contains the appsign and appId information obtained from the site.

- !You must create a new account by going to zegocloud.com and then open a new project and get a new appsign and appId value. These are the ones on the page called constvariable.dart.
- Then, by pressing "quick start", your flutter_video_call_app application can serve as a video conferencing application if you follow the required requirements step by step (For example, you will be asked to create a file named proguards-rules in the android\app\proguards-rules.pro path.). 

- I wish you success in your projects.
